Data analysts are in high demand across all kinds of industries. More and more companies, all around the world, are becoming increasingly data-centered. And with that shift has come a surge in demand for data analysts to help put this data to work. Because there aren't enough people to fill these open jobs, many of the organizations trying to recruit data analysts are having a difficult time. When a particular industry faces a situation like this one, it's called a talent gap.

The recruitment agency has collected data about job applications for opportunities posted on its website, but only for the year 2019. This data contains information about the jobs for which people applied, if they submitted their application for the job opening using the agency's easy-apply process, and whether the applicant was ultimately hired. I created a spreadsheet dashboard using this data to analyze and display KPIs that provide insight into the agency's performance in 2019.

Following are some questions I answered:

•	For each job title, what percentage of the total applications submitted did they receive?

•	What was the total number of applications received per month?

•	What was the trend in the total number of applications received per month?

•	Which months had the least and greatest number of total applications received?

•	What was the average number of applications received per month?
